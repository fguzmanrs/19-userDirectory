# User Directory

This is an employee directory with React. 

## User Story

AS A user, I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once SO THAT I have quick access to their information.


## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Use Directory as follows:

* Given a table of random users
* When the user loads the page, a table of employees renders.
* User can then"
- Sort the table by at least one category
- Filter the users by at least one property.
